## Google Calendar Clone

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To run the server and build project (webpack will watch for changees -w), run this command:

`npm start`

And navigate to http://localhost:3000

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will
update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
